## Problem Statement

In this project, we focused on working with classifier models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc, and natural language processing techniques such as pulling text off the web with APIs, parsing text with tokenizers and regex expressions, vectorizing text into features that can be trained on with classifiers to draw conclusions.  

We hoped to use these techniques to classify text data as belonging to one of two subreddits, which we selected.  For my project, I chose the subreddits r/AskMen and r/AskWomen.  These are moderately large volume subreddits, the purpose of which is to allow redditors to post a question to be answered exclusively by male or female redditors, respectively.  What I realized is that the direct comment replies to the parent thread should be overwhelmingly gender specific, men answering in AskMen and women answering in AskWomen.  Can we use natural language processing and classification models to classify such comments as belonging to one sub or the other?  By extension, can we differentiate men answering questions aimed at men, from women answering questions aimed at women?

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The major takeaway from this 
- discuss most successful models, notes from confusion matrix in leading model...
-discuss experiences with overfitting...
and how we were able to really capture what seemed like gendered dialectical elements, esp with ngrams of size 2 and 3...  
-discuss how logreg coefficients can be translated
-discuss learning experience from upvote modeling
