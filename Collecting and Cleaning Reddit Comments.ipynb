    "Reddit, like many websites that produce large amounts of data that people may want to access, has what is called an API (Application Programming Interface).  Essentially this is a set of definitions, protocols, and tools that make data available in an accessible format for developers.  However, API's will typically have fairly strict limitations about the amount of data one can access, at least without paying a premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit's API is convenient in that it stores a lot of useful data and labeling relevant to each comment, user, etc. However, regular users of the API are limited to pulling 1000 comments at a time.  This in itself is not really an issue, but Reddit also limits users to only pulling the *most recent* 1000 comments.  This means we would have to wait for some indiscriminate amount of time between each pull, and given the volume of activity on these subreddits, it could be months or even years before we have a powerful dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is an open-source alternative to Reddit's API, called **[Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api)**. In addition to providing useful extra features, the Pushshift API has two great advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **We can specify a date and time that we want to start a pull from** (i.e.; pull the 1000 comments prior to time *t*). This allows us to create a loop backward over set intervals of time and pull as much distinct content as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The data is returned as a list of dictionaries**, which allows very easy conversion into Pandas.\n",
