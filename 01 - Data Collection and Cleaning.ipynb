    "For my project, I have chosen the subreddits r/AskMen and r/AskWomen.  The way these subreddits work is people make threads in which they ask a question looking for answers from only male or only female redditors, respectively.  So we can expect the first tier comments in each thread to be from men or women, respectively.  What I am interested in is trying to classify these first tier comments as (Man answering question in AskMen) vs. (Woman answering question in AskWomen).  Accordingly, we only want to look at first-tier comments, i.e.; direct replies to thread.  Later responses may be from either gender.  We can filter for this using the 'parent_id' feature.  First tier comments all begin with 't3_' followed by a thread id, as opposed to a comment id."

To collect more than 1000 comments, and also to reflect a wider variety of timeframes than simply the last few days, I will use a feature in the pushshift.io API that allows you to query based on a before and after timestamp.  \n",

I chose 12 days because it will quickly give me a variety of times of month, days of week, etc., and it is a large enough gap that all comments will certainly be new and I will be able to cover a full year's worth of time at least to catch all seasons.  \n",
